# ResturantHorrorGame_2025
Thank you for checking out my GitHub Page! I'll make this brief. Here are some screenshots from my personal horror game developed in Unity over the Summer of 2025. The restaurant is very inspired by a real-life location and places you in the role of an unlucky employee. The player has slept through their alarm, but something feels different...

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire creation process of this project. It taught me a lot, including:

  - Unity Scripting (C#)
  - Game Design
  - Blender Modeling
  - Scene Optimization
  - Version Control
